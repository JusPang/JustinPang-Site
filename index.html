        <p class="lead mb-4">Hi my name is Justin Pang and I am currently a student at the University of California at Riverside. I am a first year student and I was born in San Jose. I am currently 18 years old and I am currently going through my second quarter at UCR. I was raised in Cupertino and I graduated from Cupertino High School in 2019. I am currently studying Pre-Business at UC Riverside and I plan to concentrate in finance once I get into the school of business at the University of California at Riverside.

        <br><br>

        Some of my experiences that I have include volunteering at the Cupertino library. I learned many skills, but mainly organizational and communication. I was in charge of sorting books, searching for books, and helping visitors if they had any questions. I volunteered from the beginning of my freshman year and continued on until my senior year of high school. My experience volunteering at the library has helped me grow as a person because I learned it was like volunteering in an environment where hundreds of people visit in a day. Learning how to work with people was also an important skill that I learned because it improved my communication skills. Another take away from volunteering at the library was my improved organizational skills. I learned how to effectively organize things in my life, learning from how the library sorts the books has changed how I organize things in my everyday life, and made me a more orderly person. 
        <br><br>
       Another experience that I have gone through was volunteering at a program at a community college called Comptechs. Comptechs was a program that taught volunteers how to refurbish and upgrade computers. I was able to learn hands on skills on how a computer works, and was able to give the computers to those who were not able to buy their own. The program taught me a lot about being hands on, and how computers work all the circuits and components that are all in a computer. I volunteered at this program in the summer between my Junior year and my Senior year of high school, and I will value that experience because it opened my eyes on how important technology is in our life. During my time at Comptechs, I learned many different skills that are related to computers. I learned how to open up both laptop and desktop safely and upgrade many components. This would include upgrading the RAM of a laptop and desktop, the hard drive, and even the graphics card in a desktop. I also learned how to install an operating system on a computer, and learn how to wire a desktop. 

        <br><br>
        
       Currently, I am a UCR student that has just finished my first quarter of college. I plan on taking many courses, but mainly finance courses because I am interested in that field. This is because I am interested in stocks, and how the market works. I am intrigued by how by planning, raising money and investing with money.
